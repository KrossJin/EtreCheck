EtreCheck
=========
EtreCheck is an easy-to-use little app to display the important details of your system configuration and allow you to copy that information to the Clipboard. EtreCheck automatically removes any personally identifiable information from the output. EtreCheck does not need super-user privileges to run. It will also never ask for your password. It is signed with my Developer ID issued by Apple so it can be installed on systems protected by Apple's Gatekeeper system.
